\section{Synopsis}
This document will contain descriptions of the various components of the Arduino Sensor Network.  First is a brief overview of the various components and then a discussion of the communication protocol used between them.  An example network is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Example}.

  \caption{Example Sensor Network}
  \label{fig:Example}
\end{figure}

\section{Components}
The network consists of two required components plus optional components.  The required components are a single controller and one or more responders.  Listeners may optionally be added as they simply monitor the bus traffic and do not transmit.  A BeagleBone Black listener is used to present the data from the network on web pages.  Note that the component boundaries are a little fuzzy in that some components can perform functions from multiple categories.

\subsection{Controller}
The controller is responsible for the operation of the bus.  It sends a request command to each node on the bus and waits for a response.  It may also send data messages.  Typically requests are done in a round-robin fashion -- request node 1, request node 2, etc.  If a node does not respond within a timeout period, it is marked as missing and the next node is polled.

It would probably be possible to combine the controller functions and the web gateway listener function into a BeagleBone Black or other similar embedded computer.  However, keeping them separate allows the controller to be simpler and keep the network functioning even if the web gateway has problems.  So, if presenting data collected on a web page is the primary function of the network, go ahead and combine them.  If, however the primary function of the network is monitoring and controlling something, it would be better to keep the web gateway separate.

\subsection{Responder}
One or more responders may be attached to the bus.  Each responder can produce one or more addresses of data.  The first address (address 0) is used for node identification.  It contains the name and the number of addresses produced by the node.  Additional addresses are produced depending on the sensors attached to the node and the node configuration.

\subsection{Listener}
Any number of listeners may be added to the network.  These simply monitor the network traffic and usually present it in a different format.  A listener can also be used to perform actions based on certain data on the network, though it would probably be better to use a responder that can report back what it is doing.

The BeagleBone Black is used as one example of a listener that presents the data on a web page.  Another example listener is an Arduino that simply listens to the bus and copies the characters to the host computer for display.

\subsection{Web Gateway}
The web gateway is a specialized listener.  It collects data from the bus and presents it as web pages and XML formatted data.  It is uses the \texttt{Ada-Web-Server} repository as the web server.  The RS-485 listener interface is implemented as an Ada Task that receives and processes data from the bus.  The back channel is another Ada Task that is used to transmit commands to the controller.  The use of a task is intended to prevent multiple commands being transmitted simultaneously and getting garbled.

\section{Protocol}
\subsection{Physical Layer}
The physical layer is RS-485 twisted pair.  CAT-5 cable is used because I happen to have a bunch of CAT-5 available and it works.  One pair is used leaving the other pairs available for other uses such as power distribution.  The baud rate is set to 115.2kbps.  This can be changed depending on the application.  The only constraint is that all nodes agree on the baud rate.

\subsection{Node Organization}
Each node is given a unique node ID.  The controller node is given ID 0.  The message format allows 32 bits for the node ID though typically small numbers would be used.  Each node can produce a number of addresses of data.  Address 0 is used to provide node information.  The information includes the number of addresses that the node can produce and the node's name.

\subsection{Messages}
Two types of messages are defined: Requests which only come from the controller and request a specific address of data from a specific node, and Responses which are the data produced by a responder in response to a request.

To aid in debugging, the format of the messages is in ASCII text.  The type of message is indicated by the first character, `\texttt{\@}' for requests and `\texttt{\#}' for responses.  The first two elements in both types of messages is the device ID and the address separated by a forward slash, `\texttt{/}'.  The end of the message is a percent sign, `\texttt{\%}' followed by a (currently unimplemented) checksum and a CR-LF.

All of the numbers are 32 bit unsigned integers expressed in hexadecimal, with leading zeros optional.  

\subsubsection{Requests}
Requests should only be sent by the controller node.  The first character in a request message is an ampersand, `\texttt{\@}'.  This is followed by the device ID in hex, followed by a forward slash, `\texttt{/}'.  Then the address in hex.  The address is optionally followed by a command code and value, each preceded by an apmersand `\texttt{\&}'.  This is followed by a percent sign, `\texttt{\%}' and a currently unused checksum in hex.  The message is terminated by a CR-LF.

If a command code is not specified, the default command code of 0 for \texttt{CMD\_READ} is used.  The currently defined command codes are in Table \ref{tab:commands}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c l l}
    \hline
    Value & Symbol & Meaning \\
    \hline
    0 & \texttt{CMD\_READ} & Read data from the specified address.\\
    1 & \texttt{CMD\_RESET} & Perform a software reset.\\
    2 & \texttt{CMD\_WRITE} & Perform an application specific write.\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Defined Command Codes}
  \label{tab:commands}
\end{table}

A typical request looks something like, `\texttt{@00000001/00000000\%FF}'.  This requests address 0 from device 1.  Since leading zeros are optional, the same message can also be expressed as, `\texttt{@1/0\%FF}'.

\subsubsection{Responses}
Responses are sent in response to a request from the controller node.  The first character in a response message is an octathorpe, `\texttt{\#}'.  This is followed by the device ID in hex, the address in hex, and the message type in hex, separated by a forward slash, `\texttt{/}', and ended by an ampersand, `\texttt{\&}'.  This is followed by the data fields.  These are up to 32 32-bit hex numbers separated by apmersands, `\texttt{\&}' and terminated by a percent sign, `\texttt{\%}'.  This is followed by a currently unused checksum in hex.  The message is terminated by a CR-LF.

The format of the responses flexible and the number of data fields sent depends on the type of message.  It may even vary between messages of the same type.  A typical response looks something like \texttt{\#2/1/4\&0\&0\&1E690\&175C0F1\&C775\%FF}.  This is a response from device ID 2, address 1 with message type 4 (\texttt{MSG\_TYPE\_BME280})

If the controller has data to send, it can send a response message without sending a request, as the request can be considered to be implied.

\subsubsection{Message Types}
To make the response messages easier to decode, each message has a message type field.  This indicates what to do with the rest of the data in the message.  Not all messages are currently implemented and more will likely be added.  The various message types are in Table \ref{tab:messagetype}.  Some of the message types have a subtype.  In particular, discretes have the defined types as shown in Table \ref{tab:disctype}, with more likely to be added.  The analog values have the defined types as shown in Table \ref{tab:analogtype}, with more likely to be added.

    Value & Symbol & Meaning \\
    \hline
    0 & \texttt{MSG\_TYPE\_UNKNOWN} & Undefined or not present.\\
    1 & \texttt{MSG\_TYPE\_EMPTY} & Everything is OK, but no data to send \\
    2 & \texttt{MSG\_TYPE\_NAK} & Address not supported \\
    3 & \texttt{MSG\_TYPE\_INFO} & Address 0 information message \\
    4 & \texttt{MSG\_TYPE\_BME280} & BME280 sensor values \\

\end{table}

\subsection{Back-Channel Commands}
While the commands are human usable, they are designed for ease of parsing, not ease of use.  It is expected that higher level software will provide a wrapper for them.  At this point, they should be considered to be experimental and subject to change.  There are two groups of commands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item General commands tell the controller to do something that applies to all nodes on the network.  The specific general commands currently defined are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{!A} Tell all nodes to turn their indicator LED off.
    \item \texttt{!B} Tell all nodes to turn their indicator LED on.
    \item \texttt{!C} Tell all nodes to toggle their indicator LED.
    \item \texttt{!D} Tell all nodes to identify themselves.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Directed commands are sent to a specific node telling it to do something.  The currently defined directed commands are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{!R<node>,} Request node it node id of \texttt{<node>} to perform a software reset.
    \item \texttt{!S<cmd>,<node>,<arg>,} Send an arbitrary command, \texttt{<cmd>}, to node id \texttt{<node>}, with command arguments, \texttt{<arg>}.
  \end{itemize}
  Where all numbers are in hexidecimal.  Note that the trailing comma is required.
\end{itemize}

\section{Logging}
Data can be logged to files for later analysis.  Provisions exist for logging to be started and stopped and started on a global basis or by record type.  Starting global logging creates the files for the data and stopping global logging closes the files.  To log data, logging has to be started globally and logging of the desired data has to be enabled.  The data records generally supported for logging are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Node information records
  \item BME280 Temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor
  \item CCS811 eCO$_2$ and TVOC (total volatile organic compounds) air quality sensor
  \item TLS2561 light sensor
\end{itemize}
The discretes and analogs are customized for the application and thus any logging of them would also have to be customized.  The existing logging code can be used as an example.  Note that logging can generate an enormous amount of data, so be prepared.
