\section{Synopsis}
This document will contain descriptions of the various components of the Arduino Sensor Network.  First is a brief overview of the various components and then a discussion of the communication protocol used between them.

\section{Components}
The network consists of two required components plus optional components.  The required components are a single controller and one or more responders.  Listeners may optionally be added as they simply monitor the bus traffic and do not transmit.  A BeagleBone Black listener is used to present the data from the network on web pages.

\subsection{Physical Layer}
The physical layer is RS-485 twisted pair.  CAT-5 cable is used because I happen to have a bunch of CAT-5 available and it works.  One pair is used leaving the other pairs available for other uses such as power distribution.
